#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

**Restaurant Reviews**

I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. 
Added features:
  - accessibility;
  - responsive design;
  - service worker;

### How to run the app: 

1. Clone or download the project.
2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
